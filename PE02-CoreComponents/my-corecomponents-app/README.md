# PE02 â€“ Core Components App

This project is a simple React Native application built using Expo. It demonstrates the use of core components in React Native such as `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`, `Image`, `TextInput`, and `StyleSheet`. The purpose of this app is to display the MSCS course list in three categories: Core Requirements, Depth of Study, and Capstone, while allowing users to input their favorite course.

---

# Input

The user interacts with the app by entering the name or code of their favorite course into a `TextInput` field. Additionally, the program uses a local image file `icon.png` from the `assets/images/` folder to display at the top of the app. The course data (Core, Depth, and Capstone) is hardcoded in arrays within the main component.

---

# Process

The app is implemented using functional components and React Nativeâ€™s core components. It manages user input with the `useState` hook, and lays out the content using `ScrollView` to support vertical scrolling. The courses are categorized and displayed dynamically using the `map()` function. Styling is applied using `StyleSheet.create()` for consistent layout and design. Each section header is highlighted with a yellow background for visual separation, following the design shown in the assignment prompt.

---

# Output

The app displays:
- An image banner at the top
- A labeled input field with placeholder text
- A scrollable list of MSCS courses grouped into:
  - Core Requirements (8 courses)
  - Depth of Study (2 courses)
  - Capstone (1 course)

All components are aligned cleanly and designed to work smoothly on mobile devices using the Expo Go app or web browser.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
