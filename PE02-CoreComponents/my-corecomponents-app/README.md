# PE02 â€“ Core Components App

This project is a simple React Native application built using Expo. It demonstrates the use of core components in React Native such as `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`, `Image`, `TextInput`, and `StyleSheet`. The purpose of this app is to display the MSCS course list in three categories: Core Requirements, Depth of Study, and Capstone, while allowing users to input their favorite course.

---

# Input

The user interacts with the app by entering the name or code of their favorite course into a `TextInput` field. Additionally, the program uses a local image file `icon.png` from the `assets/images/` folder to display at the top of the app. The course data (Core, Depth, and Capstone) is hardcoded in arrays within the main component.

---

# Process

The app is implemented using functional components and React Nativeâ€™s core components. It manages user input with the `useState` hook, and lays out the content using `ScrollView` to support vertical scrolling. The courses are categorized and displayed dynamically using the `map()` function. Styling is applied using `StyleSheet.create()` for consistent layout and design. Each section header is highlighted with a yellow background for visual separation, following the design shown in the assignment prompt.

---

# Output

The app displays:
- An image banner at the top
- A labeled input field with placeholder text
- A scrollable list of MSCS courses grouped into:
  - Core Requirements (8 courses)
  - Depth of Study (2 courses)
  - Capstone (1 course)

All components are aligned cleanly and designed to work smoothly on mobile devices using the Expo Go app or web browser.
