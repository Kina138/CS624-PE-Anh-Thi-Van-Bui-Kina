# PE04 – Profile Cards

## Input

In this programming exercise, we worked with a React Native application using Expo to implement a series of styled Profile Cards. The input includes:

- A base application copied from the completed HOS05 and HOS06.
- A static user image (`user.png`) stored under `assets/images/`.
- Hardcoded profile information (name, occupation, and description) for six users.
- User interaction is performed by tapping each card to toggle between expanded and collapsed views.

## Process

This PE consists of two parts:

### Part 1: (After HOS05)

- Copied the app from HOS05 into the `PE04/Part1` folder.
- Applied text styling techniques as described in Section 4.3 of the textbook.
- Modified the `App.js` and `styles.js` files to include:
  - User’s name, occupation, and description inside the Profile Card.
  - Proper font styles, alignment, and spacing.
- Took a screenshot of the full Profile Card UI.

### Part 2: (After HOS06)

- Copied the updated app from HOS06 into `PE04/Part2`.
- Built a gallery layout of six Profile Cards using `flexbox`.
- Installed and used the `immutability-helper` package for state updates.
- Each card can toggle between full view and thumbnail when clicked.
- Added drop shadows with `elevation` (Android) and `ShadowPropTypesIOS` (iOS).
- Saved screenshots of both collapsed and expanded states.

## Output

The final app displays a responsive gallery of six interactive Profile Cards. Each card includes:

- A circular profile image with shadow effects.
- Text content styled for clarity and readability.
- Tap functionality to toggle between expanded and collapsed views.
- A clean and modern layout using `flexDirection`, `flexWrap`, and other flexbox properties.

All UI screenshots have been saved in the PE04 folder. The project has been pushed to GitHub as required.
